<p>
We are an interdisciplinary team of researchers at the University of Virginia using concepts from cyber-phyiscal systems to make transportation infrastructure systems more resilient to flooding. Our work is funded by the National Science Foundation through <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1735587&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">an award</a> from their Critical Resilient Interdependent Infrastructure Systems and Processes (CRISP) program.
